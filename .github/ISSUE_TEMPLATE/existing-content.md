Please use this ticket to a discussion about ideas already in the collection, whether to challenge them outright, offer a different perspective,
or refine them.

While the intent is for these ideas to be broadly useful and applicable, we won't pretend that they're universal or that we will all
agree on them. This _is_ a curated collection so we may not accept with every proposal, but we are happy to discuss them to improve this
collection and our own ideas.
