## Identifiers used within Systems

Basically what we're talking about is various "IDs" that are to refer to things within the system.

It's common to find in your software system a veritable zoo of IDs, many of which seem overlapping,
or even redundant. This zoo will grow organically as developers identify a new use case and determine
that there are no existing ID's in the system that will suffice. This determination could be accurate,
or it could be inaccurate, due to a lack of awareness of all the IDs available, a lack of understanding
of the available IDs, or a non-meaningful distinction that is being made between the new use case
and existing use cases.

Despite the variety of ways new IDs can be introduced needlessly, it would be a mistake to assume
that multiple IDs are never necessary. In the next section of this document, we will discuss some
of the different species of IDs that may be appropriately distinguished.
